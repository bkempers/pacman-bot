# Overview of the Pacman AI Bot

Developed several different AI algorithms for a pacman bot to demonstrate these algorithms in a set state.
Some of these algorithms were search methods including: breadth & depth, A-Star, Heuristic, greedy search.
Some of the algorithms were multi-agents including: reflex, minimax, alpha-beta pruning, expectimax, and evaluation agents.
And some algorithms were reinforcement learning including: value iteration, policies, q-learning (& approximate), and epsilon greedy
